The Data model 3.0 version in megiddo_upgraded_to_3_0.txt was done with Rupert's online tool.  It is wrong in many ways:  the aniso_s values are a single number instead of a colon delimited list.  
There are several records for each specimen with different entries - some have 'lithology' filled in, some do not.  
The V1, V2, V3 columns are wrong.  
the ages are at the sample level and not the site level.  
SOME of these things are fixed in the notebook ages_from_samples_to_sites.ipynb - but the program thellier_gui3.0.py still does not work properly. 
	it fails to find the prior specimen interpretation properly
 	it fails on the anisotropy correction
