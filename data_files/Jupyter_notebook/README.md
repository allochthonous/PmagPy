Open and reproducible paleomagnetic data analysis using an IPython (Jupyter) notebook
================================

This repository contains an example IPython (Jupyter) notebook that was developed for the Tauxe et al., 2015 manuscript on the PmagPy project

To run the code in the notebook it is necessary to both install PmagPy and have an installed Python distribution that includes IPython and the other standard scientific python libraries (http://www.scipy.org/). Installation instructions for both PmagPy and Canopy Python can be found in the [PmagPy Cookbook](http://earthref.org/PmagPy/cookbook/).  Both Canopy Python and Anaconda Python come with IPython already installed.  If you use a different version of Python, you can find good instructions for installing IPython/jupyter here: http://ipython.org/install.html.

Once you have Python and PmagPy, just type `jupyter notebook` in your command line.  Alternatively, you can open a notebook in the Canopy application. If you just want to view a static version of the notebook online with the Jupyter nbviewer, click this link:
