<P>

<P>
The <I>ErMagicBuilder </I>is a Python tool for adding metadata to your MagIC project.<br>

The top row in the dialog window shows the current headers for each table. The required headers are added and cannot be removed. The bottom row in the dialog window shows a list of optional headers.<br>
(Details on MagIC model different headers are in: <TT><A NAME="tex2html0"
  HREF="http://earthref.org/MagIC/metadata/">"http://earthref.org/MagIC/metadata/"</A></TT>)<br>
<BR>
 To add or remove headers from your project model: choose the header name and click the add/remove buttons.  It is <em>possible</em> to add headers and edit data for headers that deal with interpretations, however it is <em>recommended</em> that you generate that data dynamically using Thellier GUI or Demag GUI in the next step.  The Builder step is primarily intended to add metadata like geologic class, lithology, age, and so on.
<BR>
<p>
After you choose the headers of the tables press the OK button.  This will open a sequence of grids where you can fill in missing information.  Note that some headers -- i.e., those dealing with interpretations -- you need not fill in here.  Instead, you will be able to generate those interpretations programatically in the next step.  If this seems confusing, don't worry -- you can always repeat this step if you find you need to add additional information.
